# hello-world

A bit about myself: I wrote a dissertation on population viability analysis using R. I also used R to create simulation models of populations of lilies to test hypotheses about the evolution of dormancy as a life history trait. Now I want to learn to use R to do more in-demand data analysis. Why? Because of that whole supply-demand-cost dynamic, I suppose. And because I really love data analysis and using R. Since graduation I have worked as a teaching professor, and long to get back into reading the data to find and tell its stories. Nature is full of hidden patterns. As scientists, we try to identify those patterns and attribute them to underlying processes and laws. The invention of the microscope allowed us to see what had been right in front of our faces all along. Data analysis tools will do the same, allow us to see patterns that have been in front of us, and explore them the same way we have explored the microscopic world. Carl Sagan described science as a candle in the dark. Data analysis focuses, broadens, intensifies, filters, and resolves the image we get from the candle light of science. Or something.
